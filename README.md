# Predictive_Maintenance_For_Milling_Machine

## Overview
Predictive Maintenance for Milling Machines is a project aimed at utilizing data-driven techniques to anticipate equipment failures before they occur. By applying machine learning models to sensor data, we can reduce machine downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and extend machine lifespan.

## Background
Milling machines are key assets in manufacturing but are prone to wear and tear, leading to unexpected breakdowns and expensive repairs. Predictive maintenance enables us to leverage historical and real-time data to predict when maintenance is needed, minimizing downtime and avoiding catastrophic failures.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the failure of milling machines based on sensor data, environmental factors, and historical maintenance records. 
This model will help:
* Reduce unexpected machine downtime.
* Optimize maintenance schedules.
* Minimize operational costs.
