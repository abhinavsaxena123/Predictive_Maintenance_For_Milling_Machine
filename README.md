# Predictive_Maintenance_For_Milling_Machine

## Overview
Predictive Maintenance for Milling Machines is a project aimed at utilizing data-driven techniques to anticipate equipment failures before they occur. By applying machine learning models to sensor data, we can reduce machine downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and extend machine lifespan.

## Background
Milling machines are key assets in manufacturing but are prone to wear and tear, leading to unexpected breakdowns and expensive repairs. Predictive maintenance enables us to leverage historical and real-time data to predict when maintenance is needed, minimizing downtime and avoiding catastrophic failures.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the failure of milling machines based on sensor data, environmental factors, and historical maintenance records. 
This model will help:
* Reduce unexpected machine downtime.
* Optimize maintenance schedules.
* Minimize operational costs.

## Data Description:
Dataset source: Kaggle, UCI
* Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephanmatzka/predictive-maintenance-dataset-ai4i-2020

This synthetic dataset is modeled after an existing milling machine and consists of 10 000 data points from a stored as rows with 14 features in columns.
1. UID: unique identifier ranging from 1 to 10000
2. product ID: consisting of a letter L, M, or H for low (50% of all products), medium (30%) and high (20%) as product quality variants and a variant-specific serial number
3. type: just the product type L, M or H from column 2
4. air temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process later normalized to a standard deviation of 2 K around 300 K
5. process temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process normalized to a standard deviation of 1 K, added to the air temperature plus 10 K.
6. rotational speed [rpm]: calculated from a power of 2860 W, overlaid with a normally distributed noise
7. torque [Nm]: torque values are normally distributed around 40 Nm with a SD = 10 Nm and no negative values.
8. tool wear [min]: The quality variants H/M/L add 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear to the used tool in the process.
9. 'machine failure' label that indicates, whether the machine has failed in this particular datapoint for any of the following failure modes are true.
